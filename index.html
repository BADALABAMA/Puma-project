            A first step in a long history driven by a speed and perfomance: The
            brothers Rudolf and Adolf Dassler founded the company "Grebruder
            Dassler Schuhfabrik" (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory) in their
            hometown Herzogenaurach, Gremany. The brothers started their factory
            in their parents'home in 1919, moving into its proper facility in
            1924. 28 years after founding their company, the Dassler brothers
            fell out and went separate ways. Rudolf Dassler moved inro another
            building, which belonged to the family. Together witch 14 employees,
            he transformed this storage facility into a factory and founded his
            own company. On October 1, 1948 "PUMA" was registered at the German
            Patent and Trademark Office.

            Prior to 1968, the world had yet to adopt wearing sneakers fo
            leisure, or better yet, collecting for their own preasure. That
            meant shoes were purpose built and PUMA shoes we trainign shoes
            only. However, the world was changing, and PUMA's first "lifestyle"
            shoes the "CRACK" which was launched in 1968 prior to the Olympics
            in Mexico. Word "CRACK" was used to describe the best of its kind,
            for example the best player of a sport. To be called the "CRACK" of
            one's team was the highest possible award and, by transferring this
            connotation onto the shoe, one was perfectly able to highlight the
            actuality and superiority of the shoe.

                and he did it wearing PUMA CRACK. At the medal ceremony, Tommie
                approached the podium with bronze-medalist John Carlos. Both
